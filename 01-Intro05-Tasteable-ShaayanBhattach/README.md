There is a folk rule stating that ice cream tastes best when it is at least seven weeks older than than half the shelf life. For example, an 18 week shelf life tastes best when it is at least 16 weeks old ( 7 + ( 18 / 2 ) ).

Produce a program that first prompts and reads an integer for a variable named _shelfLife_. The program then computes and displays the time when the ice-cream tastes best according to the folk rule.

 Sample program run 

```
Enter the shelf life: **19**
```

```
19 week shelf life tastes best when it is at least 16 weeks old.
```

 Sample program run 

```
Enter the shelf life: **22**
```

```
22 week shelf life tastes best when it is at least 18 weeks old.
```
