There is a folk rule stating the number of pages you should read before giving up on a book is _100 - your age_. For example, a 21 year old needs to read 79 pages ( 100 - 21 ).

Produce a program that first prompts and reads an integer for a variable named _age_. The program then computes and displays the minimal number of pages to read.

Create a static method to perform the calculation.

 Sample program run 

```
Enter your age: **18**
```

```
18 year olds should read at least 82 pages before giving up on a book
```

 Sample program run 

```
Enter your age: **30**
```

```
30 year olds should read at least 70 pages before giving up on a book
```
