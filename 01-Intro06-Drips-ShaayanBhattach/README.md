Ever wonder how much water is wasted by a dripping faucet? Well now is your chance to develop a dripping faucet calculator.  Write a program that computes the amount of wasted water for a particular drip rate and time interval.

In developing your program

- define a constant which stores the fact that there are 15140 drips per gallon [source US Geological Service website].  
- The first input is the number of drips per minute coming from the faucet as a decimal number. 
- The second input is the number of days as an integer

_Perform calculations in a static method._

Sample program run

```
Enter faucet drips per minute: **3.75**
```

```
Enter number of days: **30**
```

```
A faucet with 3.75 drips per minute over 30 days will waste 10.700132100396301 gallons of water
```

Sample program run 

```
Enter faucet drips per minute: **7.5**
```

```
Enter number of days: **1**
```

```
A faucet with 7.5 drips per minute over 1 days will waste 0.71334214002642 gallons of water
